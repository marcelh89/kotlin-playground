/**
 * Exercise 1
 * Using a when expression, update the following program so that when you input the names
 * of GameBoy buttons, the actions are printed to output.
 *
 * Exercise 2
 * You have a program that counts pizza slices until thereâ€™s a whole pizza with 8 slices.
 * Refactor this program in two ways:
 *
 * Exercise 3
 * Write a program that simulates the Fizz buzz game. Your task is to print numbers from 1 to 100 incrementally,
 * replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".
 * Any number divisible by both 3 and 5 must be replaced with the word "fizzbuzz".
 *
 * Exercise 4
 * You have a list of words. Use for and if to print only the words that start with the letter l.
