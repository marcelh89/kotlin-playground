/**
 * Exercise 1
 * Define a data class Employee with two properties: one for a name,
 * and another for a salary. Make sure that the property for salary is mutable,
 * otherwise you wonâ€™t get a salary boost at the end of the year! The main function
 * demonstrates how you can use this data class.
 */

/**
 * Exercise 2
 * To test your code, you need a generator that can create random employees.
 * Define a class with a fixed list of potential names (inside the class body),
 * and that is configured by a minimum and maximum salary (inside the class header).
 * Once again, the main function demonstrates how you can use this class.
